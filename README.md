To preserve battery of my notebook, I connected the power source into a Wemo Switch and every day at 11AM wemo app run a schedule to turn the power off.

This script run from contab and when battery level drop to less than 10%, it connect to wemo switch and turn it on.

Still work in progress to make if configurable.
